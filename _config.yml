events:
- title: <3 Snowboarding
  date: 2005
  desc: Moved to the west coast and immediately fell in love with snowboarding. Everyone I met here was already shredding since 10 years old, so my skills improved very quick riding with them!
- title: CASI Certification Complete!
  date: 2007
  desc: As a highschool student, lift passes were expensive. I wanted a job on the mountain for a free pass, but I wanted to improve my snowboarding and recruit more snowboarders in hopes to one day outnumber the skiers.
- title: Grouse Mountain
  date: 2012
  desc: After a few seasons I got enough exposure to feel confident on my own. At Grouse Mountain I taught kids as young as 7 years old; to even an adult in their 70's! International groups, school groups, and Christmas/March Break Camps!
- title: All on my own
  date: 2014
  desc: I have continued teaching mostly friends and family in my free time. I love seeing students' faces light up when they realize they made it to the bottom of the hill without my help; completed their first turn; or carved confidently all the way down some blues!
